# RayStation-scripts
This repository contains a set of IronPython 2.7 scripts for the RayStation Treatment Planning System. The scripts provide basic functionality and serve as examples of how the scripting environment works. The scripts are divided into two sets, one for ROI and POI functions and another one for extracting information on the plans.
